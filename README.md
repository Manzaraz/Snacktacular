## Snackacular App

Hello everyone! I'm Chris, a frontend developer who is taking his first steps into the exciting world of mobile development, using the Swift language with SwiftUI Framework. On this occasion, I have the pleasure of presenting my latest project: "Snacktacular".
"Snacktacular" is an application that allows you, in the form of a social network, to share your culinary experiences at your favorite restaurants. With this app, you can post the location of your preferred establishments, upload photos of the delicious dishes you have enjoyed, and leave a review about them.
To make this possible, I have implemented the sign-in process through Firebase, so that you can log in to the application and share your experiences in a secure manner. Additionally, I have worked on data persistence and have used SwiftData to handle the information efficiently.
I hope you enjoy exploring "Snacktacular" as much as I enjoyed creating it! If you like the project, feel free to give it a "Star" on GitHub. Thank you for your support!
